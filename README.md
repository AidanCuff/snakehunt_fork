# Snake Hunt: A Multiplayer Web Game with Python
## John Bernardin, Jaffar Alzeidi, Sean Britt, Katrina Janeczko

### Description
A multiplayer snake game. Each player controls a snake. Each snake must avoid colliding other snakes and consume pellets to grow. There will be a leaderboard which keeps track of the lengths of the snakes in-game. Upon starting the game, each player enters a name to distinguish themselves from other players. When two snakes collide, the larger snake consumes the smaller snake and gains a portion of its length. Food pellets are of random colors. When a snake consumes a pellet, its color changes to match that of the specific pellet that it consumed.

# How to run
On Windows:

Download snake-hunt.exe. Your antivirus software and Windows Defender may give you warnings about downloading the executable, but just ignore them. This executable is found in the dist folder in this Github repository.

In the above repo, use a terminal to get into the 'Game' directory, then run the command `python snake_oop.py`, and you should get a Pygame window with a simple working snake game.
