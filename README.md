# Snake Hunt: A Multiplayer Web Game with Python
## John Bernardin, Jaffar Alzeidi, Sean Britt, Katrina Janeczko

### Description
A multiplayer snake game. Each player controls a snake. Each snake must avoid colliding other snakes and consume pellets to grow. There will be a leaderboard which keeps track of the lengths of the snakes in-game. Upon starting the game, each player enters a name to distinguish themselves from other players. When two snakes collide, the larger snake consumes the smaller snake and gains a portion of its length. Food pellets are of random colors. When a snake consumes a pellet, its color changes to match that of the specific pellet that it consumed.

# How to run
To run the game's proof of concept, you will need to download Python (https://www.python.org/downloads/) (preferably version 3.7 or newer) and install Pygame(https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted). You will need to clone [this repo](https://github.com/katrinajaneczko/snake-game) so that you can run the python file locally.<br>

In the above repo, use a terminal to get into the 'Game' directory, then run the command `python snake_oop.py`, and you should get a Pygame window with a simple working snake game.
